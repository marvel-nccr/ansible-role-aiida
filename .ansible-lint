# use `# noqa xxx` at the end of a line, to ignore a particular error
# or add to the warn_list, to ignore for the whole project
warn_list:
  - '106'  # Role name {} does not match ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`` pattern
  - '208'  # File permissions unset or incorrect
  - '305'  # Use shell only when shell functionality is required
  - '503'  # Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
